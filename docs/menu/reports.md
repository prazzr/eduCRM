# Reports Menu Documentation

## Overview
The Reports module (`modules/reports/dashboard.php`) provides data-driven insights into the consultancy's performance. It aggregates data from Tasks, Appointments, Inquiries, and User activity.

## Features

### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Task Completion**: Percentage of tasks completed vs assigned.
- **Attendance Rate**: Appointment show-up rate (crucial for consultancy efficiency).
- **Conversion Rate**: Leads turned into Students.
- **Velocity**: Average time (in days) to complete standard tasks.

### 2. Visual Analytics
- **Conversion Funnel**: Visualizes the drop-off at each stage of the lead pipeline (New -> Contacted -> Converted).
- **Trend Analysis**: Line charts showing activity volume over time.
- **Date Filtering**: Users can slice data by standard ranges (7/30/90 days) or custom dates.

### 3. Team Performance
- **Counselor Leaderboard**: A detailed table comparing staff members on tasks, appointments, and conversion success.
- **Export**: Data can be exported to CSV for external analysis.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1.  **Revenue Reporting**:
    - **Suggestion**: Add a "Financial Health" section showing Total Invoiced vs Total Collected.

2.  **PDF Reports**:
    - **Suggestion**: Implement a "Download PDF Report" feature for monthly management meetings.

3.  **Marketing Attribution**:
    - **Suggestion**: A chart showing "Leads by Source" (e.g., Facebook vs Google vs Walk-in) to optimize marketing spend.

4.  **Forecasting**:
    - **Suggestion**: Use historical data to project "Expected Enrollments" for the next month.
